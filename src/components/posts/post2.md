# What is UX Design

UX Design is the process of designing products and making them:

* Enjoyable
* Usable
* Useful
* Equitable to interact with

UX is focused just on the **user** and nothing else. It hopes to increase conversion, clicks and overall enjoyability with the characteristics described above! Here is a list of ways to have [better UX](https://blog.shift4shop.com/improve-website-user-experience).

You can check out my article on each of these attributes [here](https://kai-pereira.hashnode.dev/ux-characteristics).

An example of a product you are designing could be a site. Let's say you are building an E-commerce site:

* Enjoyable could be nice UI and a little popup when you buy something
* Usable could be it has some filters to find the right product
* Useful could be a clear layout and goal in mind like buying the product
* Equitable could be a language change setting and text to speech

Making your product like this will definitely encourage them to buy more, come back and have a special bond between the product and the user!
